# Predicting-Restaurant-Tips-Using-Predictive-Analytics-in-Exce
This project explores how customer and billing attributes influence tipping behavior in restaurants. Using Microsoft Excel and its Data Analysis Toolpak, I built a predictive model to estimate tip amounts based on independent variables.
- Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset containing tip records, including categorical variables like gender, smoker status, and day of visit.
- Encoded categorical data using logical conditions and Excel formulas.
- Identified independent and dependent variables for regression modeling.
- Applied linear regression to predict tip amounts and evaluated model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
- Delivered a mathematical equation for tip prediction based on input features.
